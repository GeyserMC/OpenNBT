For alternative NBT libraries in Java, please see [ViaNBT](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaNBT) (derived from an earlier version of OpenNBT) or [CloudburstMC's NBT implementation](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/NBT) (what MCProtocolLib now uses). Both have active maintenance as of the time of this repository's archival.

# OpenNBT
OpenNBT is a library for reading and writing NBT files and stringified NBT, with some extra custom tags added to allow the storage of more data types.

## Building the Source
OpenNBT uses Maven to manage dependencies. Simply run 'mvn clean install' in the source's directory.
